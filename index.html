                   <h2>Dr. Laxmi Shrestha</h2>
                   <p>
                    As a neurosurgeon, I am committed to helping people overcome neurological issues and lead healthier lives. I take great pride in my work and am constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge to provide the best possible care to my patients.

                    When I am not in the operating room, I enjoy expressing myself through dance. Dancing has been a significant part of my life since childhood, and it brings me joy and helps me stay mentally and physically fit. I also enjoy mountain climbing as it challenges me physically and mentally and helps me push my limits.

                    In addition to my professional and personal pursuits, I am also passionate about politics and social work. I believe in using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on society and strive to help those in need. Whether it is by advocating for better healthcare policies or volunteering at a local shelter, I am always looking for ways to contribute to my community.

                    Overall, my diverse interests and passions have helped me become a well-rounded individual, and I am excited to see where these pursuits will take me in the future.
